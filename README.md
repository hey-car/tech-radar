# heycar Technology Radar

We use [ThoughtWorks-introduced](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor) Technology Radar as a way to document and align on our state of all the techniques, platforms, tools, languages, and frameworks used across heycar. If there are multiple comparable technologies for similar purposes (e.g. Lighthouse and Sentry for performance monitoring) Technology Radar also provides context and high-level guidance on how they are used at heycar and whatâ€™s the difference. Our own technology radar is supposed to guide our engineers to pick the best solution for their needs as well as to help new-joiners to onboard into our technology landscape.

You can find the nicely-visualised version of the Radar [here](https://radar.thoughtworks.com/?sheetId=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhey-car%2Ftech-radar%2Fmaster%2Ftech-radar.csv) or also access the the radar as [CSV file](https://github.com/hey-car/tech-radar/blob/master/tech-radar.csv) directly.
